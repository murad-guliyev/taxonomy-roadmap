    content: `On March 27, the Sustainable Banking and Finance Network (SBFN) hosted the Sustainable Finance Taxonomies Roundtable in Johannesburg, South Africa. Held on the sidelines of the Africa Sustainability Forum, organized by the Capacity-building Alliance of Sustainable Investment (CASI), the Roundtable brought together regional and local policymakers, practitioners, and experts in sustainable finance taxonomies.

The discussion focused on identifying key opportunities for greater harmonization and effective implementation of taxonomies. Nearly 20 participants emphasized the need for increased interoperability between existing and new sustainable finance taxonomies in the region and globally, underscoring its importance for facilitating cross-border investments and alignment with global standards.

The Roundtable provided an opportunity to learn about recent developments, challenges, and offer practical solutions to enhance collaboration and alignment in taxonomy development and application.

The discussion forms part of the implementation of the Roadmap for Advancing Interoperability and Comparability of Sustainable Finance Taxonomies (Taxonomy Roadmap). Launched during COP29 in Azerbaijan in November 2024, the initiative is a joint effort by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Sustainable Banking and Finance Network (SBFN), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF).

As next steps, the participants called on the organizers to establish platforms for more effective regional knowledge sharing, explore how taxonomies can better support the Just Energy Transition, and how to reduce the complexity and reporting burden for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).`,

    content: `Leading global institutions and initiatives convened a roundtable in Geneva to discuss implementation of the Roadmap for Advancing Interoperability and Comparability of Sustainable Finance Taxonomies (Taxonomy Roadmap). Launched during COP29 in Azerbaijan last November, the initiative is a joint effort by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Sustainable Banking and Finance Network (SBFN), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF).

Hosted by UNDP, the roundtable marked a key milestone in the implementation of the Roadmap, bringing together key organizations and initiatives working on sustainable finance taxonomies. In addition to the founding partners, United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), the EU Sustainable Finance Advisory Hub (for low and middle income countries), UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) joined as partners.

Reflecting on COP29, the roundtable participants emphasized the growing importance of interoperability in the global sustainable finance ecosystem. It was agreed that the Taxonomy Roadmap will serve as a key global platform for coordination, collaboration and alignment of taxonomy initiatives, helping organizations better align their efforts, reduce redundancies, and establish stronger linkages between their activities/efforts and the Roadmap's key pillars.

During roundtable discussions, the participants shared updates on their current taxonomy-related initiatives, tools, or country support programs, and outlined possible next steps for implementing the Taxonomy Roadmap.

Partners also stressed the importance of connecting these efforts with global policy forums, including the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group, the UN's 4th International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4), and COP30 & COP31.`,

    content: `The "Roadmap for Advancing Interoperability and Comparability of Sustainable Finance Taxonomies" (Taxonomy Roadmap Initiative) was successfully launched by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Sustainable Banking and Finance Network (SBFN), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF) during the Sustainable Finance Taxonomies event held in Baku, Azerbaijan during COP29.

The initiative aims to facilitate cross-border investment flows into sustainable activities, in line with Article 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement. The focus is to showcase progress on the Taxonomy Roadmap, driven by joint collaboration, coordination and communication.

Since the launch, the initiative has expanded its partnership from the founding partners to 13 global and public partners. Notably, the Brazil Ministry of Finance, representing the Presidency of COP30, joined the initiative to further advance the implementation along the Road of Baku to Bel√©m.

The Roadmap was officially unveiled during COP29's Finance, Investment, and Trade Day at a high level event titled "Advancing Sustainable Finance across the Globe: Roadmap towards Interoperability and Comparability of Sustainable Finance Taxonomies."

This marks the beginning of a collaborative journey towards achieving greater interoperability and comparability of sustainable finance taxonomies worldwide, with the ultimate goal of facilitating cross-border green capital flows and supporting the transition to a sustainable economy.`,
