    content: `This event builds on the momentum of the Sustainable Finance Taxonomies event held in Baku, Azerbaijan during COP29, where the "Roadmap for Advancing Interoperability and Comparability of Sustainable Finance Taxonomies" (Taxonomy Roadmap Initiative) was launched by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Sustainable Banking and Finance Network (SBFN), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF).

The initiative aims to facilitate cross-border investment flows into sustainable activities, in line with Article 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement. The focus of this event is to showcase progress on the Taxonomy Roadmap, driven by joint collaboration, coordination and communication.

Since the launch, the initiative has expanded its partnership from the founding partners to 12 global and public partners. Notably, the Brazil Ministry of Finance, representing the Presidency of COP30, joined the initiative to further advance the implementation along the Road of Baku to Belém.

**Key Elements to be Showcased:**

i. Identifying a common core set of taxonomy economic activities, particularly in EMDEs.

ii. Developing common technical approaches for alignment with taxonomy principles and essential criteria, including Do No Significant Harm (DNSH), Minimum Social Safeguards (MSS) and ESG guidelines.

• Formulating common approaches to finance the transition through taxonomies.

**Additional Areas for Greater Alignment:**

• Inclusivity in alignment approaches, ensuring small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), women and vulnerable groups.

• Verification and assurance mechanism.

**Initiative Activities:**

The initiative partners have engaged in high-level discussions and roundtables sharing the insights of sustainable finance taxonomies and interoperability at major forums such as G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group meetings, BRICS Taxonomy Working Group meeting, IPSF Sherpa Meeting, and Hamburg Sustainability Conference 2025, and UN Financing for Development Conference (FfD4). The initiative partners have been developing flagship tools and deliverables.

The event will feature the initiative's three key tools and deliverables, including the Progress Report, Global Taxonomy Mapper, Website of Initiative, and Interoperability Principles. A panel discussion will explore synergies among these activities, offering strategies and recommendations for taxonomy implementation and facilitating cross-border investment, particularly in emerging markets and developing countries.`,

This event marked the beginning of a collaborative journey towards achieving greater interoperability and comparability of sustainable finance taxonomies worldwide.

The event was titled "Advancing Sustainable Finance across the Globe: Roadmap towards Interoperability and Comparability of Sustainable Finance Taxonomies" and was held during COP29's Finance, Investment, and Trade Day.

**Event Highlights:**

• Official launch of the "Roadmap for Advancing Interoperability and Comparability of Sustainable Finance Taxonomies"

• Presentation of the three key technical elements for enhancing taxonomy interoperability

• Introduction of founding partners and their commitment to the initiative

• Discussions on the importance of cross-border investment flows into sustainable activities

• Alignment with Article 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement objectives

**Impact and Outcomes:**

The launch event successfully established the foundation for ongoing collaboration among global institutions working on sustainable finance taxonomies. It created momentum for subsequent roundtables and working sessions that have continued to advance the implementation of the Roadmap.

Since the launch, the initiative has grown from the founding partners to include additional global organizations, demonstrating the strong interest and support for taxonomy interoperability efforts worldwide.`,
